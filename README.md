## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During the time I spent writting this code I really learnt a lot from adding drag and drop to elements, to making dynamic elements, to making use of user inputs to make a list etc. It was really hard one for me though I must admit but I'm so happy right now, I did it. Thnaks to frontEndMentor and every brain behind this projects, you guys are awesome.

### Continued development

In some other future projects I will code I'll really love to try it out with some React though still learning that but I beleive I'll be good enough soon
